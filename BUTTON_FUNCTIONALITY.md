# Button Functionality Test Guide

This document explains how to test the save and clear button functionality in Flint.

## Fixed Issues

### Save Button ‚úÖ
- **Problem**: Save button was not connected to any functionality
- **Solution**: Implemented proper button connection with file dialog
- **Status**: Now working

### Clear Button ‚úÖ  
- **Problem**: Clear button was not connected to any functionality
- **Solution**: Implemented proper button connection with annotation clearing
- **Status**: Now working

## Testing the Save Button

### How to Test:
1. **Launch Flint**: `cargo run`
2. **Take Screenshot**: Click "üì∑ Take Screenshot" 
3. **Draw Something**: Use any tool to draw on the screenshot
4. **Click Save**: Click the "üíæ Save" button in the toolbar
5. **Verify**: File dialog should appear
6. **Save File**: Choose location and filename, click "Save"
7. **Check Result**: Status bar should show "Saved to [path]"

### Expected Behavior:
- File dialog opens immediately when save button is clicked
- Default filename is "flint-screenshot.png"
- File saves as PNG format
- Status bar updates with save location
- Console shows: `INFO flint: Save button clicked`

### What Gets Saved:
- Original screenshot as background
- All drawn annotations overlaid on top
- Final image is rendered as PNG

## Testing the Clear Button

### How to Test:
1. **Launch Flint**: `cargo run`
2. **Take Screenshot**: Click "üì∑ Take Screenshot"
3. **Draw Multiple Things**: Use different tools to create several annotations
4. **Click Clear**: Click the "üóëÔ∏è Clear" button in the toolbar
5. **Verify**: All annotations should disappear immediately

### Expected Behavior:
- All drawn annotations are removed instantly
- Screenshot background remains visible
- Status bar shows "Cleared X annotations" (where X is the count)
- If no annotations exist, shows "No annotations to clear"
- Console shows: `INFO flint: Clear button clicked`

### What Gets Cleared:
- All finished strokes
- Current stroke (if drawing)
- Pencil, line, arrow, and highlighter marks

## Technical Implementation

### Save Functionality:
```rust
// Button connection in editor.rs
self.toolbar.connect_save_clicked(move || {
    Self::handle_save_action(/* parameters */);
});

// File rendering process:
1. Create Cairo surface with image dimensions
2. Draw screenshot as background
3. Draw all annotations on top
4. Convert to RGBA image format
5. Save as PNG file
```

### Clear Functionality:
```rust
// Button connection in editor.rs  
self.toolbar.connect_clear_clicked(move || {
    let stroke_count = tools_for_clear.borrow().strokes.len();
    tools_for_clear.borrow_mut().clear_all();
    drawing_area_for_clear.queue_draw();
});

// Clear process:
1. Count existing annotations
2. Clear strokes vector
3. Clear current stroke
4. Redraw canvas
5. Update status bar
```

## Troubleshooting

### Save Button Issues:
- **Dialog doesn't appear**: Check console for error messages
- **Save fails**: Verify write permissions to selected directory
- **File corrupted**: Check if drawing area has valid screenshot loaded

### Clear Button Issues:
- **Annotations don't disappear**: Check if drawing area redraws after clear
- **Status not updated**: Verify status bar connection is working
- **Console errors**: Look for annotation tool error messages

## Debugging Commands

```bash
# Run with full logging
RUST_LOG=debug cargo run

# Check save functionality logs
grep -i "save\|file" output.log

# Check clear functionality logs  
grep -i "clear\|annotation" output.log
```

## Integration with Other Features

### Copy Button Status:
- **Current**: Basic implementation (saves to temp file)
- **Future**: Full clipboard integration planned

### Tool Integration:
- Save: Works with all annotation tools
- Clear: Removes annotations from all tools
- Both: Work regardless of currently selected tool

## User Experience Notes

### Visual Feedback:
- Save: Status bar shows save location
- Clear: Status bar shows count of cleared items
- Both: Buttons remain responsive during operation

### Error Handling:
- Save failures show error in status bar
- Clear works even with no annotations
- File permission errors are handled gracefully

## Performance Notes

- Save operation is fast (< 1 second for typical screenshots)
- Clear operation is immediate
- Both operations don't block the UI
- Memory usage remains low during operations

## Future Enhancements

### Save:
- Additional file formats (JPEG, WebP)
- Custom filename patterns
- Auto-save functionality
- Cloud service integration

### Clear:
- Selective clearing (by tool type)
- Undo/redo integration
- Clear confirmation dialog
- Partial clear (last N strokes)
